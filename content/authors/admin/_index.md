I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Pennsylvania State University in the Department of Statistics, working under [Prof. Bing Li](https://science.psu.edu/stat/people/bxl9) and [Prof. Lingzhou Xue](https://lingzhou-xue.github.io/).  
I received my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis while working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) in September, 2022. 

My primary research centers around analyzing functional and non-Euclidean data situated in general metric spaces, which we refer to as \emph{random objects},  with examples in brain imaging data, networks, distribution valued data, and high-dimensional genetics data.
A motivating data example is the functional connectivity correlation network of fMRI signals represented as correlation matrices between the different nodes of the brain, which reside in a space that is not linear and there is no concept of direction. However, the connectivity correlation matrices can be perceived as random objects in a metric space, endowed with a suitable metric.

My other research interests include
- \emph{Functional and longitudinal data analysis, and its overlap with metric geometry} for studying samples of time-varying metric space-valued data, examples being dynamic networks or distribution objects
- \emph{Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces}- developing abstract mathematical and computational methods for infinite dimensional data in connection with metric geometry and sufficient dimension reduction.
- \emph{Nonparametric statistics, analysis of high-dimensional and geometrical data}.
- \emph{Causal inference for distributional and object data}- developing methodological work for object data analysis with application in the fields of bio-sciences.
- \emph{Theoretical Machine Learning}- contextual bandit problems.

<!---Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. I am also a contributor and past maintainer of the R package [fdapace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdapace/index.html). 

A motivating example for much of my work arises in the study of human growth curves, in which several body measurements are tracked from infancy to adulthood. In my PhD, my methodological projects involved identifying systematic phase variation in growth spurts across both individuals and different modalities of growth (e.g. arms, legs, spine). My research approaches this problem by exploring models which can quantify intercomponent time dynamics for multivariate functional data, like time warping and time shifting frameworks. --->

Beyond developing methodology, I like teaching and mentoring young minds to kindle and foster statistical thinking and logical reasoning skills. I like finding intuitive and creative ways of conveying results and breaking through the "language barrier" between statisticians and other scientists. 


With much of my working time spent behind a computer screen, I find a lot of value in connecting to the natural world when I have the chance. In free moments you'll probably find me on a trail, in a river, or road tripping around Central PA.

<!--- Since coming to Davis I've become somewhat of an amateur naturalist and developed an interest in citizen science projects. --->
