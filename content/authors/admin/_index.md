I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Pennsylvania State University in the Department of Statistics.  My primary research centers around analyzing functional and non-Euclidean data situated in general metric spaces,  with examples in brain imaging data, networks, distribution valued data, and high-dimensional genetics data.

I received my PhD in Statistics at UC Davis while working with [Prof. Hans-Georg MÃ¼ller](https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/) in September, 2022. 


Data taking values in metric spaces, which we refer to as \emph{random objects}, are becoming increasingly common in many real-life applications. Often such data objects appear as samples of graph Laplacians, covariance matrices, and probability density functions among others, with examples in brain imaging data, traffic networks, distribution valued data, and high-dimensional genetics data. A motivating data example is the functional connectivity correlation network of fMRI signals represented
as correlation matrices between the different nodes of the brain, which reside in a space that is not linear and there is no concept of direction. However, the connectivity correlation matrices can be perceived as random objects in a metric space, endowed with a suitable metric

<!---Broadly, I am interested in the treatment of complex structured data whose geometries thwart traditional, off-the-shelf statistical methods. In particular I am attracted to questions concerning functional data, especially when the functions are multivariate, contaminated by warping, or subject to constraints, as in the case of densities or monotonic curves. I am also a contributor and past maintainer of the R package [fdapace](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fdapace/index.html). 

A motivating example for much of my work arises in the study of human growth curves, in which several body measurements are tracked from infancy to adulthood. In my PhD, my methodological projects involved identifying systematic phase variation in growth spurts across both individuals and different modalities of growth (e.g. arms, legs, spine). My research approaches this problem by exploring models which can quantify intercomponent time dynamics for multivariate functional data, like time warping and time shifting frameworks. --->

Beyond developing methodology, I'm also a fan of working as a statistical consultant in my research. I like finding intuitive and creative ways of conveying results and breaking through the "language barrier" between statisticians and other scientists. My applied collaborations span a wide variety of domains: in the past I've collaborated with conservationists at The Nature Conservancy, neuroscientists from the Salk Institute and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the researchers behind Mt. Everest's Himalayan Database, to name a few.

With much of my working time spent behind a computer screen, I find a lot of value in connecting to the natural world when I have the chance. In free moments you'll probably find me on a trail, in a river, or road tripping around Northern CA.

<!--- Since coming to Davis I've become somewhat of an amateur naturalist and developed an interest in citizen science projects. --->
